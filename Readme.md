#Readme.md

---

Initially designed to test saving files to a Github repository along with saving a file via Notepad++.  The goal of this project is to:

1) Develop a simple map, ideally running off Leaflet 
2) Integrate a database of transportation features which has already been converted to geoJSON  
3) Try new leaflet abilities

This readme was copied over from my LeafletMap repository.  Based on research I might end up retiring that repository and move all my work to this new Github Pages repository.
