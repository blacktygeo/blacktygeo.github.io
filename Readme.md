Initially designed to test saving files to a Github repository along with saving a file via Notepad++.  The goal of this project is to:

1) Develop a simple map, ideally running off Leaflet 
2) Integrate a database of transportation features which has already been converted to geoJSON  
3) Try new leaflet abilities

Thanks to many awesome sources, I was able to cobble together a basic knowledge of what is going on in JavaScript and determine how to make a Leaflet map utilizing marker clustering.  At this point, I would like to clean up my GeoJSON database with transit operator names which didn't carry over from my older file GeoDatabase.
